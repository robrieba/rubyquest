You have long heard the legend of the Ruby of Reshith.  Anyone who touches
it, truly desiring to return to their home, will be instantly transported to
their place of origin.  It is both of incalculable value and power.

Finding the Ruby of Reshith is no small feat.  It has been lost in Labyrinth
of Tohu, a dangerous dungeon, filled with numerous perils.  Pits pock-mark
this maze, adding hazard to peril.  Thankfully, you have both the rope and the
skill to make a ladder, but sadly, you can only have enough rope to fashion
three.
